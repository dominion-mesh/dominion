# Dominion Mesh by Mirantis
Dominion is a blueprint for deploying, managing, and securing AI Agents and MCP Servers.

Own your own sovereign system for Agentic AI!  Dominion integrates and wraps together a number
of key open source technologies to accelerate your time to value for developing agentic workflows,
deploying them in production, and securing them with confidence.  It initially includes:

- Terraform for bootstrapping k0rdent (below) onto the cloud of your choice
- k0rdent (Mirantis multi-cloud, multi-cluster management system for Kubernetes)
- Istio (in ambient mode) for zero-trust networking, routing, and ingress
- AgentGateway (by Solo.io) as a secure MCP Gateway and L7 proxy

The roadmap and plan calls for making this blueprint as pluggable and composable as possible, such
that it supports a variety of AI and MCP gateways.
